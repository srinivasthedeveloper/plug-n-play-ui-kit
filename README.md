# Plug-N-Play-Ui-Kit

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/plug-n-play-ui-kit.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/plug-n-play-ui-kit)

Plug-N-Play-Ui-Kit is a design system built with Storybook, Vite, React, TypeScript, and styled-components. It provides a powerful and customizable UI kit for your web applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with Plug-N-Play-Ui-Kit, follow these steps:

### 1. Installation

You can install the library using npm:

```bash
npm install plug-n-play-ui-kit
```

### 2. Usage

#### Theming:

To avoid theming issues on components, make sure to wrap your entire application with the `PlugNPlayContainer` component at the root element level. This will provide the correct theme to all components within your app.

Example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { PlugNPlayContainer, darkTheme } from 'plug-n-play-ui-kit';
import App from './App'; // Replace with your root component
import './index.css';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <PlugNPlayContainer theme={darkTheme}>
      <App />
    </PlugNPlayContainer>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

#### TypeScript Configuration:

To ensure TypeScript can correctly find the declaration files for Plug-N-Play-Ui-Kit, add the following paths to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "plug-n-play-ui-kit": ["./node_modules/plug-n-play-ui-kit/dist/index.d.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues like "Could not find a declaration file for module 'plug-n-play-ui-kit,'" make sure to follow the above instructions carefully. If the issue persists, consider the following:

- Ensure Vite or your build tool correctly handles TypeScript declaration files and module resolution.
- Make sure you're using the latest version of Plug-N-Play-Ui-Kit.
